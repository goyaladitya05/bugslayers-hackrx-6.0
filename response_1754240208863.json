      "answer": "Based on the provided excerpt, the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is as follows:\n\nExpenses related to the treatment of a Pre-Existing Disease (PED) and its direct complications are excluded until the expiry of thirty-six (36) months of continuous coverage from the date of inception of the first policy.\n\nThis waiting period can be reduced if the Insured Person has been continuously covered under a previous policy, as per the portability norms of the extant IRDAI (Health Insurance) Regulations. The reduction would be to the extent of the prior coverage period.\n\nFurthermore, coverage for any pre-existing disease after the thirty-six-month waiting period is contingent upon the disease having been declared at the time of application and accepted by the company."
